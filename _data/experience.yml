    I currently work at DivideBuy, helping them rebuild and refactor their <mark>FinTech</mark> application. I work as part of a multi-national team that has many developers, QA testers and a BA. I help drive the team and decide the direction and structure of the application. 
    
    I spend my time working on developing <mark>Microservices</mark> in the <mark>Laravel</mark> and <mark>Lumen</mark> <mark>PHP</mark> frameworks. The application consists of several <mark>Angular</mark> frontends that talk to a series of APIs to provide smooth and seemless user journeys.
    
    In the background there are a series of message queues that help process data. They also form the core of a feedback loop for machine learning to help drive credit decisions. 
    
    I enjoy getting to know all the areas of our app, which allows me to be the person to go to for system knowledge. I deal with managing a team, helping my staff learn and providing insight on a day to day basis. I also love looking for areas to improve our app and make it more performant and better for our users.
