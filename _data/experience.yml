    I currently work at DivideBuy, helping them rebuild and refactor their <mark>FinTech</mark> application. I work as part of a multi-national team that has many developers, QA testers and a BA. I help drive the team and decide the direction and structure of the application. 
    
    I spend my time working on developing <mark>Microservices</mark> in the <mark>Laravel</mark> and <mark>Lumen</mark> <mark>PHP</mark> frameworks. The application consists of several <mark>Angular</mark> frontends that talk to a series of APIs to provide smooth and seemless user journeys.
    
    In the background there are a series of message queues that help process data. They also form the core of a feedback loop for machine learning to help drive credit decisions. 
    
    I enjoy getting to know all the areas of our app, which allows me to be the person to go to for system knowledge. I deal with managing a team, helping my staff learn and providing insight on a day to day basis. I also love looking for areas to improve our app and make it more performant and better for our users.

    UK Fuels Limited is a Fuel Card company that provides commercial rate fuel to business.

    I worked with them to create a Sales Agent <mark>Management System</mark> based on the <mark>Django Framework</mark>. It is a <mark>Python</mark> app that allows management staff to enter statistics on sales agents. The statistics are then used to generate reports on a regular basis. 

    It features views to show different statistics to different user groups. This includes showing sales agents calculated commission based on their sales volume. 

    The application makes use of migrations to control the data models.

    I also provided day to day tech support for the sales and admin team.
