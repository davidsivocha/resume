    I currently work at DivideBuy, helping them rebuild, refactor and improve their <mark>FinTech</mark> application. I lead a multi-national team of circa 30 developers, QA testers and Business Analysts. I help drive the team and decide the direction and structure of the technology stack, as well as providing mentorship to developers in the Department. 
    
    I spend my time working on developing <mark>Microservices</mark> in the <mark>Laravel</mark> and <mark>Lumen</mark> <mark>PHP</mark> frameworks. The application consists of several <mark>Angular</mark> and <mark>VueJS</mark> frontends that talk to a series of APIs to provide smooth and seemless user journeys.
    
    In the background there are a series of message queues that help process data. They also form the core of a feedback loop for machine learning to help drive credit decisions. My team has recently helped moved the application stack to an <mark>Event-sourced</mark> pattern of working. 
    
    I have enjoyed getting to know all the areas of our software estate, which allows me to be the person to go to for system knowledge. I deal with managing a team, helping my staff learn and providing insight on a day to day basis. I also love looking for areas to improve our applications and make them more performant for our users as well as improving the <mark>UX</mark>.
    
    During my time here I have also been instrumental in assisting with out of hours support organisation as required and in working on key infrastructure components such as our <mark>AWS</mark> stack.
    
    I have also lead the project that has seen DivideBuy change from a more Waterfall orientated pattern of development, to more <mark>Agile</mark> working practices that includes the incorporation of <mark>CI/CD</mark> pipelines and automatic quality assurance tools, as well as a transition to container driven environments using <mark>Docker</mark> running on <mark>Kubernetes</mark> to provide easily replicated environments for Developers and Testers to work in.

    I was responsible for converting a <mark>Wordpress</mark> site into a more fully featured <mark>Laravel</mark> Application, optimising the Database, and improving functionality with new features. 
    
    Part of this was using Haversine formula for managing rapid lookups in the Database for Properties within certain radiuses (assisted with using bounding boxes to create subsets of data). 
    
    The redevelopment of the uCribs site was supported with a <mark>Bootstrap</mark> based frontend that used <mark>KnockoutJS</mark> to handle front end interface. KnockoutJS was used to provide <mark>Single Page Application</mark> style interaction on the site.
    
    I was also responsible for managing the site on a fully load balanced <mark>AWS</mark> using OpsWorks with custom written <mark>Chef</mark> recipies to control application deployment and rollout.

    UK Fuels Limited is a Fuel Card company that provides commercial rate fuel to business.

    I worked with them to create a Sales Agent <mark>Management System</mark> based on the <mark>Django Framework</mark>. It is a <mark>Python</mark> app that allows management staff to enter statistics on sales agents. The statistics are then used to generate reports on a regular basis. 

    It features views to show different statistics to different user groups. This includes showing sales agents calculated commission based on their sales volume. 

    The application makes use of migrations to control the data models.

    I also provided day to day tech support for the sales and admin team.
